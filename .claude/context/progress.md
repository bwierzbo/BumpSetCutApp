# Project Progress

## Current Status

**Branch:** `main`  
**Remote:** `https://github.com/bwierzbo/BumpSetCutApp.git`  
**Last Updated:** September 1, 2025

## Recent Development Activity

### Recent Commits (Last 10)
- `7f6374d` - Restore local changes after accidental .git deletion
- `27771c4` - reverted library view pre file structure to do it better  
- `77df6dc` - huge updates new model, rally is working well
- `e13c041` - debug fixes and changed from every frame processing to every 3rd frame
- `30b0a70` - added debug mode fixed issues with length of processing
- `7a178fa` - adding debug mode
- `bfd458d` - working on debug mode
- `554389f` - huge code refactor, split video processor into a ton of files
- `e3ede29` - working on videoprocessor for ball tracking logic
- `5d8bcc3` - huge progress working model and video processing

## Current Working State

### Completed Work
- **Core Video Processing Pipeline**: Multi-stage volleyball detection system implemented
  - YOLO-based ball detection with CoreML
  - Kalman filter tracking for ball trajectory
  - Physics-based validation using ballistics modeling
  - Rally detection with hysteresis logic
  - Video segmentation and export functionality

- **Debug Mode Implementation**: Performance-optimized debug visualization
  - Processes every 3rd frame instead of every frame
  - Real-time annotation overlay system
  - Debug video export with detection visualizations

- **Major Code Refactoring**: Video processor modularized into specialized components
  - Separated detection, tracking, logic, and export components
  - Improved maintainability and testability
  - Clean separation of concerns

- **UI Architecture**: SwiftUI-based interface with proper state management
  - Video capture integration via MijickCamera
  - Library view for processed videos
  - Modal processing interface
  - File-based storage system

### Current Issues & Cleanup
- **Cleanup in Progress**: Large number of deleted ccpm files (project management system files)
  - 70+ deleted files from ccpm/.claude/ directory
  - Appears to be removing old project management tooling
  - Main app code unaffected

- **Xcode State**: User interface state file modified (normal development activity)

### Outstanding Changes
- Untracked `.claude/` directory with new project management setup
- New `CLAUDE.md` configuration file
- Modified Xcode workspace user data

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Commit Current Changes**: Clean up the working directory by committing or discarding pending changes
2. **Performance Optimization**: Continue refinement of video processing performance
3. **Testing Framework**: Establish formal testing for video processing components
4. **Error Handling**: Enhance robustness of video processing pipeline

### Technical Debt
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of video processing objects
- **Memory Optimization**: Optimize for large video file processing
- **Cancellation Handling**: Improve graceful cancellation of long-running tasks

### Development Focus Areas
- **Rally Detection Accuracy**: Fine-tune physics parameters and detection thresholds
- **User Experience**: Streamline video processing workflow
- **Export Options**: Expand video export format and quality options
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for processing time and accuracy

## Development Velocity

**Recent Activity Level:** High - Multiple commits over recent period focusing on:
- Core algorithm improvements (rally detection working well)
- Performance optimizations (frame processing reduction)
- Code organization and maintainability
- Debug tooling enhancements

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully implemented computer vision pipeline for volleyball analysis
- Achieved working rally detection with good accuracy
- Established clean, modular architecture
- Integrated debug visualization system
