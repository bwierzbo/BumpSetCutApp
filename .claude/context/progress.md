# Project Progress Status

## Current Status

**Repository**: BumpSetCut iOS App for Volleyball Rally Detection
**Branch**: main
**Repository URL**: https://github.com/bwierzbo/BumpSetCutApp.git
**Last Major Epic**: metadatavideoprocessing (completed)
**Current Focus**: TikTok-style Rally Player Implementation & Swift 6 Concurrency Migration

## Recent Work Completed

### Major Development Session: TikTok-Style Rally Player
- **Duration**: Current development session
- **Scope**: Complete TikTok-style rally viewing experience with individual video files
- **Key Achievements**:
  - ‚úÖ **TikTok Rally Player**: Implemented `TikTokRallyPlayerView` with individual rally video export
  - ‚úÖ **Auto-play/Loop**: Videos automatically start from beginning and loop seamlessly
  - ‚úÖ **Swipe Navigation**: Vertical (portrait) and horizontal (landscape) swipe between videos
  - ‚úÖ **Tap Controls**: Tap-to-pause/play functionality with state tracking
  - ‚úÖ **Clean Interface**: No visible video controls, TikTok-style user experience
  - ‚úÖ **Swift 6 Migration**: Resolved all main actor isolation issues and concurrency warnings
  - ‚úÖ **Memory Leak Fixes**: Implemented sliding window limits to prevent crashes on large videos
  - ‚úÖ **App Responsiveness**: Reverted complex nonisolated patterns to restore UI functionality

### Critical Technical Resolutions
- **Memory Management**: Fixed unbounded array growth in VideoProcessor, KalmanBallTracker, and DebugAnnotator
- **Concurrency Compliance**: Full Swift 6 compatibility with proper actor isolation
- **Video Export**: Individual rally segments exported as separate MP4 files for seamless playback
- **State Management**: Simplified AppSettings architecture for reliable UI responsiveness

## Immediate Next Steps

### Development Priorities
1. **Code Stabilization**: Review and commit current unstaged changes
2. **Feature Integration**: Ensure all metadata processing features are fully integrated
3. **Testing Validation**: Validate new rally player and metadata overlay functionality
4. **Performance Optimization**: Review video processing pipeline efficiency
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update technical documentation to reflect new capabilities

### Technical Debt
- Clean up debug output and logging statements
- Optimize memory usage in video processing pipeline
- Enhance error handling for edge cases in rally detection
- Improve UI responsiveness during long processing operations

## Key Metrics

### Codebase Statistics
- **Primary Language**: Swift (iOS SwiftUI)
- **Project Type**: iOS App (Xcode project)
- **Architecture**: Clean Layer Architecture (4 layers)
- **Test Coverage**: Manual testing with sample videos
- **Core ML Models**: 2 models (best.mlpackage, bestv2.mlpackage)

### Development Velocity
- **Last Epic Duration**: 7 tasks completed in recent sprint
- **Commit Frequency**: High activity with 10 commits in recent development cycle
- **Feature Completeness**: MetadataVideoProcessing epic 100% complete

## Project Health Indicators

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Clear architectural separation and clean code organization
- Comprehensive video processing pipeline with advanced ML integration
- Strong documentation and PRD discipline
- Active development with consistent commit history
- Robust error handling and graceful degradation patterns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Attention
- Multiple unstaged changes need review and commit
- New PRD documentation needs integration
- Performance optimization opportunities in video processing
- Test coverage relies on manual testing (opportunity for automation)

### üîÑ Current Focus
- Stabilizing recent metadata processing enhancements
- Preparing for next development cycle
- Maintaining code quality and architectural integrity
