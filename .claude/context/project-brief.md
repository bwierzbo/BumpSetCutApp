# Project Brief

## What BumpSetCut Does

BumpSetCut is an iOS app that uses artificial intelligence to automatically identify and extract volleyball rally segments from recorded videos. The app analyzes video footage frame-by-frame, tracks volleyball movement using computer vision, and creates clean, shareable clips of the most important moments.

**Core Capability:** Transform hours of volleyball footage into a curated collection of rally highlights with zero manual editing required.

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Volleyball players, coaches, and analysts spend countless hours manually reviewing game footage to find and extract meaningful rally sequences. Traditional video editing requires:
- Manually scrubbing through entire games to find action
- Determining exact start/stop points for each rally
- Technical video editing skills to create clean segments
- Significant time investment that scales poorly with video volume

### The Solution Approach
Leverage modern computer vision and machine learning to automate the detection and segmentation process:
- **Intelligent Detection**: YOLO-based object detection specifically trained for volleyball recognition
- **Physics-Informed Tracking**: Kalman filter tracking validated by real-world physics constraints  
- **Smart Segmentation**: Evidence-based rally boundary detection using hysteresis logic
- **Mobile-Native Processing**: On-device processing for privacy and immediate results

### Technical Innovation
The system combines multiple AI/ML techniques in a sophisticated pipeline:
1. **Computer Vision**: CoreML-powered volleyball detection with static object suppression
2. **Object Tracking**: Kalman filter with association gating for trajectory consistency  
3. **Physics Modeling**: Ballistics validation using projectile motion equations
4. **State Machine Logic**: Hysteresis-based rally detection to prevent false triggers
5. **Temporal Analysis**: Time-windowed decision making for robust boundary detection

## Project Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Automation**: Eliminate manual video editing for volleyball rally extraction
2. **Accuracy**: Achieve high precision in rally detection with minimal false positives
3. **Performance**: Process typical game videos in reasonable time on mobile devices
4. **Usability**: Create intuitive mobile-first user experience requiring no technical expertise

### Technical Objectives
- **Detection Accuracy**: >95% correct identification of actual rally sequences
- **Processing Speed**: Process 1 hour of video in <10 minutes on modern iPhone
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage under 500MB for typical processing tasks
- **Reliability**: <5% failure rate across diverse video conditions

### User Experience Objectives
- **Simplicity**: Single-tap processing with intelligent defaults
- **Transparency**: Debug mode to build user trust in automated decisions
- **Flexibility**: Support various video formats and quality levels
- **Integration**: Seamless iOS ecosystem integration (Photos, sharing, etc.)
