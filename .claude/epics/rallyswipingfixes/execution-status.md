# Rally Swiping Fixes Epic - Execution Status

## Epic Overview
Complete refactoring of rally player gesture and video management systems to eliminate initialization delays, system errors, and gesture inconsistencies.

## Current Phase: Foundation (Sequential Tasks)

### Active Agents
- **Agent-1**: Issue #47 Video Resource Optimization - Analysis complete, implementation starting
  - Status: In Progress (Design ‚Üí Implementation)
  - Focus: AVPlayer resource management, FigPlayerInterstitial error fixes
  - Expected completion: ~16-20 hours

### Ready to Launch (Sequential)
- **Issue #48**: State Management Unification
  - Status: Ready after #47 completion
  - Dependencies: Requires #47 video resource foundation
  - Effort: 12-16 hours

### Queued for Parallel Phase (After #48)
- **Stream A**: Gesture & Animation Systems
  - Issue #49: Gesture System Consolidation (12-16 hours)
  - Issue #50: Animation System Simplification (14-18 hours)

- **Stream B**: Features & Infrastructure
  - Issue #52: Orientation Handling Enhancement (10-14 hours)
  - Issue #54: Action Persistence & Undo (14-18 hours)

### Performance & Integration Phase
- **Issue #51**: Performance Monitoring Integration
  - Dependencies: Requires #49 (gesture timing) + #50 (animation FPS)
  - Effort: 10-14 hours

- **Issue #53**: Component Integration Testing
  - Dependencies: ALL other tasks (#47-52, #54)
  - Effort: 20-24 hours
  - Must be final task

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
1. ‚úÖ #47 Analysis & Design Complete
2. üîÑ #47 Implementation (In Progress)
3. ‚è≥ #48 Ready to launch after #47

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (After #48)
Will launch 3 parallel streams:
- **Stream A**: #49 + #50 (Gesture/Animation - closely related)
- **Stream B**: #52 + #54 (Independent features)
- **Stream C**: #51 (Performance monitoring - after Stream A)

### Phase 3: Integration (After All)
- **Final**: #53 (Integration testing and validation)

## Success Criteria Tracking
- **Performance**: <50ms gesture response, 60fps animations, <500ms initialization
- **Quality**: Zero FigPlayerInterstitial errors, native iOS feel
- **Reliability**: No memory leaks, proper resource cleanup
- **Integration**: Zero regression in existing functionality

## Branch Status
- Working branch: epic/rallyswipingfixes
- Worktree location: /Users/benjaminwierzbanowski/Code/epic-rallyswipingfixes
- Base branch: main
- GitHub epic: https://github.com/bwierzbo/BumpSetCutApp/issues/46

## Next Actions
1. Complete #47 implementation phase
2. Launch #48 immediately after #47 completion
3. Monitor for parallel phase readiness
4. Track success criteria throughout execution
