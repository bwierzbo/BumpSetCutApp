# Video Management

## Overview
Add video renaming, moving, and context menu interactions (long-press and triple-dot) to provide comprehensive video management capabilities within the file browser.

## Requirements

### Context Menu Interactions
- Long-press gesture on video items to open context menu
- Triple-dot button for explicit context menu access
- Context menu options: Rename, Move, Delete, Properties

### Video Renaming
- Modal dialog for renaming videos
- Input validation (no special characters, duplicate names)
- Real-time preview of new filename
- Update both file system and data model

### Video Moving
- Folder selection interface for moving videos
- Drag-and-drop support between folders
- Batch move operations for multiple videos
- Progress indication for move operations

### User Experience
- Smooth animations for context menu appearance
- Haptic feedback for long-press interactions
- Undo capability for destructive operations
- Confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions

## Technical Implementation

### Context Menu Component
- Reusable context menu with configurable actions
- Position calculation to stay within screen bounds
- Gesture recognition for long-press and tap-outside-to-close

### File Operations Service
- Rename video files with validation
- Move videos between folders with error handling
- Update VideoFileItem metadata after operations
- Batch operation support with progress tracking

### State Management
- Update folder contents after move operations
- Refresh video lists when files are renamed
- Maintain selection state during operations
- Error state handling and user feedback

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Data model must be complete for file metadata updates
- Task 003: Folder operations foundation required for move functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Long-press opens context menu on video items
- [ ] Triple-dot button provides alternative context menu access
- [ ] Rename dialog validates input and updates file system
- [ ] Move operation updates folder contents correctly
- [ ] Batch operations work with multiple selected videos
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Undo functionality available for destructive operations

## Testing
- Test context menu positioning on edge cases
- Validate rename operations with various filename patterns
- Test move operations between different folder types
- Verify batch operations with large video selections
- Test error scenarios (insufficient permissions, disk full)
