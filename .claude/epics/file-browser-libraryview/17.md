# Upload Enhancement

## Overview
Implement progress tracking, naming, and folder selection during upload to provide a comprehensive upload experience with user control and visibility.

## Requirements

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time upload progress with percentage and transfer rate
- Visual progress bar with smooth animations
- Cancel capability during upload process
- Multiple file upload with individual progress tracking

### Upload Naming
- Pre-upload naming dialog for custom filenames
- Auto-generated names with timestamp/sequence options
- Bulk naming patterns for multiple file uploads
- Filename validation and conflict resolution

### Folder Selection
- Destination folder picker during upload initiation
- Recent folders quick-access for convenience
- Create new folder option within upload flow
- Default folder preference settings

### Upload Flow
- Drag-and-drop upload support
- File picker integration for device storage
- Preview thumbnails before upload confirmation
- Upload queue management for large batches

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Component
- Modal progress dialog with cancel button
- Progress calculation based on upload bytes
- Transfer rate calculation with smoothing
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Naming Service
- Filename generation with customizable patterns
- Duplicate detection and auto-increment
- Validation against file system constraints
- Batch naming with sequence numbers

### Folder Selection UI
- Hierarchical folder tree with expand/collapse
- Search within folder structure
- Recent/favorite folders for quick access
- Folder creation modal integrated in selection

### Upload Manager
- Queue-based upload system with concurrency limits
- Resume capability for interrupted uploads
- Metadata extraction and thumbnail generation
- Integration with existing data model updates

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Data model required for video metadata storage
- Task 003: Folder operations needed for destination selection and creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Upload progress displays accurately with cancel option
- [ ] Naming dialog allows custom filenames with validation
- [ ] Folder selection shows complete folder hierarchy
- [ ] Multiple file uploads work with individual progress
- [ ] Drag-and-drop uploads trigger enhanced flow
- [ ] Upload queue manages large batches efficiently
- [ ] Error handling provides clear recovery options
- [ ] Completed uploads appear in selected destination folder

## Testing
- Test upload progress accuracy with various file sizes
- Validate naming conflicts and resolution strategies
- Test folder selection with deep directory structures
- Verify drag-and-drop functionality across browsers
- Test upload cancellation and queue management
- Validate upload resumption after network interruption
