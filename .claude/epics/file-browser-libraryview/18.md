# Search & Sorting

## Overview
Add cross-folder search and advanced sorting options to enable efficient discovery and organization of video content across the entire library.

## Requirements

### Cross-Folder Search
- Global search across all folders and subfolders
- Real-time search results with debounced input
- Search by filename, metadata, and tags
- Search result highlighting and context
- Search history and saved searches

### Advanced Sorting Options
- Sort by date (created, modified, accessed)
- Sort by name (alphabetical, natural order)
- Sort by file size (ascending, descending)
- Sort by processing status (rally analysis completion)
- Custom sort combinations and preferences

### Search Filters
- Filter by file type and format
- Filter by date ranges with calendar picker
- Filter by processing status and metadata
- Filter by folder location with hierarchy
- Combine multiple filters with AND/OR logic

### Search Interface
- Prominent search bar with suggestions
- Advanced search panel with filters
- Search results view with folder context
- Quick filter buttons for common searches

## Technical Implementation

### Search Engine
- Indexed search for fast cross-folder queries
- Full-text search with stemming and fuzzy matching
- Metadata indexing for advanced search capabilities
- Incremental index updates on file changes

### Sorting Service
- Multi-criteria sorting with stable algorithms
- Custom sort comparators for different data types
- Sort preference persistence and user profiles
- Performance optimization for large collections

### Filter System
- Composable filter predicates with logical operators
- Date range parsing and validation
- Status-based filtering with rally integration
- Folder hierarchy filtering with path matching

### Search UI Components
- Autocomplete search input with suggestions
- Filter chips with remove/edit capabilities
- Results list with infinite scroll and virtualization
- Search result highlighting and snippets

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Data model required for searchable metadata
- Task 004: LibraryView foundation needed for search results display

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search finds videos across all folders instantly
- [ ] Advanced sorting works with multiple criteria
- [ ] Filters combine logically for refined results
- [ ] Search results show folder context and highlights
- [ ] Search performance remains fast with 100+ videos
- [ ] Sort preferences persist between sessions
- [ ] Search history provides quick re-search options
- [ ] Filter UI is intuitive and responsive

## Testing
- Test search accuracy with various query types
- Validate sorting consistency across different data
- Test filter combinations with edge cases
- Verify search performance with large video collections
- Test search result navigation and context
- Validate sort preference persistence and loading
