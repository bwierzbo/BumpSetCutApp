# Enhanced LibraryView

## Description
Update the LibraryView UI to support the new folder-based navigation system. This includes implementing folder navigation, breadcrumbs, improved sorting options, and a modern file browser interface that provides an intuitive user experience for managing video collections.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement folder navigation with expandable folder tree
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation showing current path
- [ ] Create context menus for folder and video operations
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for moving videos between folders
- [ ] Add multiple view modes: grid, list, and thumbnail views
- [ ] Implement advanced sorting options (name, date, size, duration)
- [ ] Add search functionality within current folder and globally
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify/Create:
- `/BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/LibraryView.swift` - Main library interface
- `/BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/FolderNavigationView.swift` - Folder tree navigation
- `/BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/BreadcrumbView.swift` - Path navigation component
- `/BumpSetCut/Presentation/ViewModels/LibraryViewModel.swift` - View state management
- `/BumpSetCut/Presentation/Components/VideoGridView.swift` - Video display components

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Navigation Interface:**
   - Implement collapsible folder tree sidebar
   - Add breadcrumb navigation bar
   - Support keyboard navigation for accessibility
   - Provide quick access to recent folders

2. **View Modes:**
   - Grid view with customizable thumbnail sizes
   - List view with detailed metadata columns
   - Thumbnail view optimized for video previews
   - Smooth transitions between view modes

3. **Interaction Features:**
   - Right-click context menus for all operations
   - Drag-and-drop support with visual feedback
   - Multi-select capabilities with batch operations
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

4. **Search & Filter:**
   - Real-time search with highlighting
   - Filter by video properties (duration, resolution, etc.)
   - Saved search queries and folder bookmarks
   - Advanced search with multiple criteria

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Virtual scrolling for large video collections
   - Lazy loading of video thumbnails
   - Efficient folder tree rendering
   - Smooth animations and transitions

## Dependencies
- **Depends on Task 001:** Requires data model for folder/video relationships
- **Depends on Task 003:** Requires folder operations for UI interactions

## Effort Estimate
- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16
- **Complexity:** High due to complex UI interactions and performance requirements

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] UI components thoroughly tested on different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance testing with large video collections
- [ ] User experience testing and feedback incorporation
- [ ] Integration tests with folder operations
- [ ] Visual regression tests for UI components
- [ ] Code review completed with UI/UX team input
