# Stream C: TrajectoryQualityScore Engine

## Scope
Create physics-based quality metrics and scoring system for trajectory patterns. Implement smoothness analysis and velocity consistency checks.

## Files
- BumpSetCut/Media/Detection/TrajectoryQualityScore.swift (new)
- BumpSetCut/Media/Utils/Types/QualityMetrics.swift (new)  
- Tests for quality scoring functionality

## Progress
- Starting implementation of trajectory quality analysis
