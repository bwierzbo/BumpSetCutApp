# Enhanced Trajectory Physics Engine

## Description

Extend the existing BallisticsGate with comprehensive parabolic validation capabilities and implement a sophisticated movement classification system. This task serves as the foundation for improved ball detection by introducing physics-based trajectory analysis that can distinguish between different types of ball movement (airborne, carried, rolling).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Extend BallisticsGate with parabolic validation functionality
- [x] Implement ParabolicValidator struct with R² correlation calculation for trajectory fitting
- [x] Create MovementClassifier that can distinguish between:
  - Airborne trajectories (following parabolic paths)
  - Carried movements (linear/irregular patterns)
  - Rolling movements (ground-constrained motion)
- [x] Implement TrajectoryQualityScore struct with metrics for:
  - Path smoothness analysis
  - Velocity consistency tracking
  - Acceleration pattern validation
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for all new physics components
- [x] Integrate with existing ball tracking pipeline without breaking changes

## Technical Details

### ParabolicValidator Implementation
- Calculate R² correlation coefficient for parabolic curve fitting
- Implement least squares regression for trajectory analysis
- Add threshold-based validation for acceptable trajectory quality
- Support configurable physics constraints (gravity, air resistance approximation)

### MovementClassifier Architecture
- State machine approach for movement type detection
- Rolling average filters for velocity and acceleration analysis
- Temporal analysis window for pattern recognition
- Confidence scoring for classification decisions

### TrajectoryQualityScore Components
- Smoothness metric: standard deviation of velocity changes
- Velocity consistency: coefficient of variation analysis
- Acceleration validation: gravity-based expected values vs observed

### Integration Points
- Extend existing BallTracker interface
- Maintain backward compatibility with current detection pipeline
- Add optional physics validation layer that can be toggled

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundation task that other tasks will depend on.

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L (Large)  
**Hours:** 16

**Breakdown:**
- ParabolicValidator implementation: 6 hours
- MovementClassifier development: 6 hours
- TrajectoryQualityScore system: 3 hours
- Testing and integration: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Code passes existing test suite
- [x] New unit tests achieve >90% code coverage
- [x] Physics calculations validated against known trajectory data
- [x] Performance benchmarks show no regression in processing speed
- [x] Code review completed and approved
- [x] Documentation updated for new physics components
