# Metrics Collection Service

## Description

Create a new lightweight MetricsCollector service to gather performance and accuracy data from the enhanced detection system. This service will track precision/recall metrics against manual ground truth data, monitor performance characteristics, and export data for analysis and system optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create new MetricsCollector.swift with lightweight data collection
- [ ] Implement precision/recall tracking against manual ground truth datasets
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for:
  - Processing time per frame
  - Memory usage patterns
  - CPU utilization during detection
- [ ] Create metrics export functionality for external analysis
- [ ] Add configurable sampling rates to minimize performance impact
- [ ] Integrate with enhanced trajectory physics engine (Task 001)
- [ ] Provide real-time metrics dashboard data
- [ ] Add metrics persistence for historical analysis

## Technical Details

### MetricsCollector Architecture
```swift
class MetricsCollector {
    // Accuracy Metrics
    func trackDetectionResult(predicted: [BallDetection], groundTruth: [BallDetection])
    func calculatePrecisionRecall() -> (precision: Double, recall: Double)
    
    // Performance Metrics
    func trackProcessingTime(duration: TimeInterval, frameCount: Int)
    func trackMemoryUsage(bytes: Int64)
    func trackCPUUtilization(percentage: Double)
    
    // Export Functions
    func exportMetrics(format: ExportFormat) -> Data
    func getMetricsSummary(timeRange: DateInterval) -> MetricsSummary
}
```

### Ground Truth Integration
- Support for manual annotation data import
- Automatic alignment of timestamps between predictions and ground truth
- Configurable tolerance thresholds for position matching
- Batch processing for historical data validation

### Performance Monitoring
- Non-intrusive measurement using minimal overhead instrumentation
- Configurable sampling rates (1%, 10%, 100% for debugging)
- Memory profiling integration with system APIs
- Frame rate impact measurement

### Export Formats
- JSON for programmatic analysis
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Custom binary format for high-frequency data
- Real-time streaming for live monitoring

### Integration Points
- Hook into enhanced BallisticsGate from Task 001
- Use configuration toggles from Task 002
- Minimal performance impact on core detection pipeline

## Dependencies

- **001 - Enhanced Trajectory Physics Engine**: Required for accessing new detection metrics and quality scores

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M (Medium)  
**Hours:** 8

**Breakdown:**
- MetricsCollector core implementation: 3 hours
- Ground truth integration and accuracy tracking: 2 hours
- Performance monitoring integration: 2 hours
- Export functionality and testing: 1 hour
