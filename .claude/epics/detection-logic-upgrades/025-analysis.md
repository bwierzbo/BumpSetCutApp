# Issue #25 Work Stream Analysis

## Overview
Integrate enhanced BallisticsGate (from Issue #21) with existing VideoProcessor pipeline. The challenge is ensuring seamless integration while maintaining performance (<10% impact) and backward compatibility. The VideoProcessor uses BallisticsGate for trajectory validation in the detection pipeline.

## Current Integration Point
VideoProcessor creates `BallisticsGate(config: ProcessorConfig())` and uses it in the processing pipeline alongside YOLODetector, RallyDecider, and SegmentBuilder.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: VideoProcessor Integration
- **Agent Type**: code-analyzer
- **Files**: 
  - `BumpSetCut/Domain/Services/VideoProcessor.swift` (modify)
  - `BumpSetCut/Domain/Logic/ProcessorConfig.swift` (verify compatibility)
- **Scope**: Update VideoProcessor to use enhanced BallisticsGate, ensure config compatibility, maintain existing API
- **Dependencies**: None (enhanced BallisticsGate already implemented)
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours

### Stream B: Performance Benchmarking & Optimization  
- **Agent Type**: code-analyzer
- **Files**:
  - `BumpSetCut/Domain/Services/VideoProcessor.swift` (profiling integration)
  - `BumpSetCutTests/Performance/VideoProcessorPerformanceTests.swift` (new)
- **Scope**: Create performance benchmarks, measure baseline vs enhanced processing, implement performance monitoring
- **Dependencies**: None (can run parallel with integration)
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours

### Stream C: End-to-End Integration Testing
- **Agent Type**: code-analyzer  
- **Files**:
  - `BumpSetCutTests/Integration/VideoProcessorIntegrationTests.swift` (new)
  - `BumpSetCutTests/Integration/BallisticsGatePipelineTests.swift` (new)
- **Scope**: Comprehensive integration tests, error handling validation, fallback mechanism testing
- **Dependencies**: Waits for Stream A (VideoProcessor integration)
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours

## Coordination Notes

### Stream A (Foundation)
- Must complete VideoProcessor integration first
- Ensures enhanced BallisticsGate is properly wired into pipeline
- Maintains existing ProcessorConfig compatibility

### Stream B (Parallel)  
- Can run immediately with existing VideoProcessor
- Creates performance baseline before and after integration
- Validates <10% performance impact requirement

### Stream C (Sequential)
- Waits for Stream A to complete VideoProcessor integration
- Tests the fully integrated system end-to-end
- Validates all acceptance criteria with real pipeline testing

## Performance Requirements
- Processing time impact <10% of baseline
- Thread-safe operation in multi-threaded environment  
- Memory usage optimization
- Error handling without pipeline disruption

## Definition of Done
- Enhanced BallisticsGate integrated with VideoProcessor pipeline
- Performance benchmarks show <10% processing time impact
- Comprehensive test coverage for integration scenarios
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing pipeline
- Error handling and graceful degradation implemented
- All acceptance criteria validated through testing

## Risk Mitigation
- Stream B provides performance baseline independent of integration
- Fallback mechanisms ensure system stability
- Comprehensive testing validates integration quality
