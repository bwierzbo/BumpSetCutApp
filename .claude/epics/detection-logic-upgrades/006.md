# Debug Visualization Tools

## Description
Create comprehensive developer tools for trajectory analysis and metrics display, enabling effective debugging and analysis of the enhanced detection logic. These tools will provide visual feedback for trajectory analysis, quality scores, and parameter tuning.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Developer tools for trajectory analysis and metrics display implemented
- [ ] Trajectory visualization with quality scores created
- [ ] Debug dashboard for analyzing false positives built
- [ ] Parameter tuning interface with real-time feedback added
- [ ] Tools integrate seamlessly with existing development workflow
- [ ] Visualization tools support real-time and offline analysis modes
- [ ] Export capabilities for analysis results and visualizations

## Technical Details

### Visualization Components
1. **Trajectory Analysis Tools**
   - Real-time trajectory path visualization with quality overlays
   - Historical trajectory comparison and analysis tools
   - Interactive trajectory editing for testing edge cases
   - Support for multiple trajectory types (serves, spikes, sets)

2. **Debug Dashboard**
   - False positive analysis with detailed breakdown
   - Quality score distribution and trend analysis
   - Performance metrics visualization (processing time, accuracy)
   - Error pattern identification and categorization

3. **Parameter Tuning Interface**
   - Real-time parameter adjustment with immediate feedback
   - A/B testing visualization for parameter comparison
   - Interactive optimization landscape exploration
   - Parameter sensitivity analysis tools

4. **Metrics Display System**
   - Real-time metrics streaming and display
   - Historical metrics trends and analysis
   - Customizable dashboard layouts and widgets
   - Export capabilities for reports and presentations

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Core Visualization Engine**
   - Use web-based visualization framework (D3.js, Three.js)
   - Support for 2D trajectory plots and 3D court visualization
   - Interactive controls for zooming, panning, and filtering
   - Real-time data streaming capabilities

2. **Developer Interface**
   - Clean, intuitive UI for developers and analysts
   - Keyboard shortcuts and power-user features
   - Session management and workspace persistence
   - Integration with existing development tools

3. **Data Integration**
   - Connect with MetricsCollector from task 003
   - Support for live data streaming and offline analysis
   - Data export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, images)
   - Historical data access and comparison tools

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient rendering for large datasets
   - Progressive loading for historical data
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Minimal impact on system performance during debugging

### Tool Categories
1. **Analysis Tools**
   - Trajectory quality scorer with visual feedback
   - False positive detector and analyzer
   - Performance profiler for detection logic
   - Statistical analysis tools for accuracy metrics

2. **Debugging Tools**
   - Step-by-step trajectory processing visualizer
   - Parameter impact analyzer
   - Error reproduction and analysis tools
   - Regression testing visualization

3. **Tuning Tools**
