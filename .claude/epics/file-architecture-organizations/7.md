# Task: Move Data Layer Files

## Description
Move all data models, storage management, and configuration files to the new Data layer directory structure. This includes the MediaStore, data structures, and utility types.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Move MediaStore to `Data/Storage/`
- [ ] Move data models and types to `Data/Models/`
- [ ] Move configuration classes to `Data/Models/`
- [ ] Update Xcode project references for all moved files
- [ ] Verify all data-related files are properly organized

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Group storage and file management in Storage subdirectory
- Organize data structures and configurations in Models subdirectory
- Maintain clear separation between data access and business logic

**Files to Move:**
- `Models/MediaStore.swift` → `Data/Storage/`
- `Media/Utils/Types/Detections.swift` → `Data/Models/`
- Configuration files (ProcessorConfig, etc.) → `Data/Models/`
- Any data structure definitions → `Data/Models/`

**Additional Considerations:**
- Look for any configuration or data model files scattered in other directories
- Ensure data types used across layers are properly located
- Consider any utility types that belong in the data layer

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Directory Setup) must be completed
- [ ] Current data access functionality working

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Presentation/Domain file moves)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MediaStore moved to Data/Storage/
- [ ] All data models in Data/Models/
- [ ] Configuration classes properly organized
- [ ] No data-related files left in wrong locations
- [ ] Xcode project references updated correctly
- [ ] Ready for import statement updates
