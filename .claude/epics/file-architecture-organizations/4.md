# Task: Create Layer-Based Directory Structure

## Description
Create the new layer-based directory structure within the BumpSetCut project. This foundational task sets up the organizational framework for all subsequent file moves.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `Presentation/` directory with subdirectories: `Views/`, `Components/`, `Popups/`
- [ ] Create `Domain/` directory with subdirectories: `Services/`, `Logic/`, `Tracking/`
- [ ] Create `Data/` directory with subdirectories: `Models/`, `Storage/`
- [ ] Create `Infrastructure/` directory with subdirectories: `ML/`, `Camera/`, `System/`
- [ ] Verify all directories are properly created in Xcode project structure

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Xcode to create new groups/folders to maintain project file references
- Create physical directories that match Xcode group structure
- Follow the layer-based organization defined in the epic

**Directory Structure to Create:**
```
BumpSetCut/
├── Presentation/
│   ├── Views/
│   ├── Components/
│   └── Popups/
├── Domain/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Logic/
│   └── Tracking/
├── Data/
│   ├── Models/
│   └── Storage/
└── Infrastructure/
    ├── ML/
    ├── Camera/
    └── System/
```

**Files Affected:**
- Xcode project file (adding new groups)
- File system (creating physical directories)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Ensure current codebase builds successfully before starting
- [ ] Create backup branch for rollback capability

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: false (foundational task required by others)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All directories created in Xcode project
- [ ] Physical directories exist in file system
- [ ] Xcode project builds without errors
- [ ] Directory structure matches epic specification
- [ ] Ready for file movement tasks
