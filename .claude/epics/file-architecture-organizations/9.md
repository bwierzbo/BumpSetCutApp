# Task: Fix All Import Statements

## Description
Update all import statements throughout the codebase to reflect the new file locations after the layer-based reorganization. This critical task ensures the app builds successfully after file moves.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update all imports in Presentation layer files to new paths
- [ ] Update all imports in Domain layer files to new paths
- [ ] Update all imports in Data layer files to new paths
- [ ] Update all imports in Infrastructure layer files to new paths
- [ ] Verify app builds without import-related errors
- [ ] Ensure no circular import dependencies

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Systematically go through each file in the new structure
- Update import statements to match new file locations
- Use Xcode's build errors to identify missing imports
- Test build frequently to catch issues early

**Types of Import Updates Needed:**
- References to moved UI components
- References to moved business logic classes
- References to moved data models
- References to moved infrastructure services
- Cross-layer imports (following dependency direction)

**Expected Import Patterns:**
```swift
// Before: import UI/View/ContentView
// After: import Presentation/Views/ContentView

// Before: import Media/Processor/VideoProcessor  
// After: import Domain/Services/VideoProcessor

// Before: import Models/MediaStore
// After: import Data/Storage/MediaStore
```

**Build Validation Strategy:**
- Fix imports in batches (by layer)
- Build and test after each batch
- Address any circular dependency issues
- Ensure clean compilation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Move Presentation Files) completed
- [ ] Task 003 (Move Domain Files) completed  
- [ ] Task 004 (Move Data Files) completed
- [ ] Task 005 (Create Infrastructure Layer) completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all file moves to be complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All import statements updated to new file paths
- [ ] App builds successfully without import errors
- [ ] No broken references in Xcode project
- [ ] Clean compilation with no warnings
- [ ] All layers can import from appropriate dependencies
- [ ] Ready for final testing phase
