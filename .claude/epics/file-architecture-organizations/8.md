# Task: Create Infrastructure Layer

## Description
Identify and move framework integrations and external dependencies to the new Infrastructure layer. This involves creating wrapper classes or moving existing framework-specific code to appropriate Infrastructure subdirectories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create or move CoreML/Vision integrations to `Infrastructure/ML/`
- [ ] Create or move MijickCamera integrations to `Infrastructure/Camera/`
- [ ] Create or move AVFoundation integrations to `Infrastructure/System/`
- [ ] Update Xcode project references for all infrastructure files
- [ ] Ensure clean separation between domain logic and framework code

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Identify framework-specific code currently mixed with business logic
- Create infrastructure wrappers where needed
- Move existing framework integrations to appropriate subdirectories

**Framework Integrations to Address:**
- **CoreML Integration**: Detection models, ML pipeline setup
- **Vision Framework**: Computer vision processing
- **AVFoundation**: Video processing, asset reading
- **MijickCamera**: Camera capture integration
- **File System**: Document directory access, file operations

**Potential Files to Move/Create:**
- Any YOLO detector implementations → `Infrastructure/ML/`
- Camera service wrappers → `Infrastructure/Camera/`
- Video file processing utilities → `Infrastructure/System/`
- Framework-specific extensions → appropriate Infrastructure subdirectory

**Key Considerations:**
- May require creating new wrapper classes for clean separation
- Some functionality might already be well-separated
- Focus on framework-specific code that doesn't belong in domain layer

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Directory Setup) must be completed
- [ ] Review of current framework integrations

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other file moves)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Framework integrations properly isolated in Infrastructure layer
- [ ] Clear separation between business logic and framework code
- [ ] CoreML/Vision code in Infrastructure/ML/
- [ ] Camera integration in Infrastructure/Camera/
- [ ] System services in Infrastructure/System/
- [ ] Xcode project references updated correctly
- [ ] Ready for import statement updates
