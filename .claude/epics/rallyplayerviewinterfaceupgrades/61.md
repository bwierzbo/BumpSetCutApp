# Task: Gesture Polish and Fine-tuning

## Description
Fine-tune the swipe gesture system to provide a more polished and responsive user experience. This includes adjusting thresholds, adding elastic bounce effects, and improving gesture cancellation behavior for edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Swipe thresholds are optimized for different device sizes and orientations
- [ ] Elastic bounce effects provide satisfying visual feedback when swiping beyond stack limits
- [ ] Gesture cancellation works smoothly when users change their mind mid-swipe
- [ ] All gesture interactions feel responsive and natural across different rally stack sizes

## Technical Details
Enhance the existing gesture system by:
- Adjusting velocity thresholds and distance requirements based on device characteristics
- Implementing spring-based elastic animations for overscroll scenarios
- Improving the gesture state machine to handle cancellation gracefully
- Adding haptic feedback for gesture boundaries

Files affected:
- RallyPlayerView.swift (gesture recognizer tuning)
- OrientationManager.swift (device-specific threshold adjustments)

## Dependencies
Depends on Task 003 (Gesture System Implementation) to be completed first, as this task builds on the foundational gesture infrastructure.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
