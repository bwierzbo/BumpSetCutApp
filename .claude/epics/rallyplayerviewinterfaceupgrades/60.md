# Task: Smart Video Preloading

## Description
Implement an intelligent video preloading strategy with 1-video lookahead to ensure smooth playback transitions. Use thumbnail fallbacks for cards 2-3 positions ahead to maintain visual consistency while managing memory efficiently. This system will preload the next video in the sequence while the current video is playing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] 1-video lookahead preloading implemented for seamless transitions
- [x] Thumbnail fallback system for cards 2-3 positions ahead in the stack
- [x] Memory management system to unload videos that are no longer needed
- [x] Preloading state indicators showing when videos are being prepared

## Technical Details
Enhance the video management system to implement smart preloading logic. Implementation will involve:
- Extending RallyNavigationState.swift to track preloading status and manage video lifecycle
- Modifying RallyPlayerView.swift to handle preloaded content and thumbnail fallbacks
- Implementing memory-efficient video loading/unloading based on position in stack
- Adding preloading state management for smooth user experience

Files affected: RallyNavigationState.swift, RallyPlayerView.swift

## Dependencies
Depends on Task 002 (Swipe Navigation Implementation) to establish the navigation system before implementing intelligent preloading based on swipe patterns.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Tests written and passing (build successful)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code reviewed
- [x] Deployed to staging (tested on device)
