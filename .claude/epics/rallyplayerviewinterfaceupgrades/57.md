# Task: Thumbnail Generation System

## Description
Create a robust thumbnail generation system for stack preview functionality using the existing FrameExtractor. This system will extract representative frames from videos and implement intelligent caching for optimal performance. The thumbnails will be used to show preview content in the background cards of the stack.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FrameExtractor enhanced to generate thumbnails at specific timestamps
- [ ] RallyCacheManager implemented with intelligent caching strategy
- [ ] Thumbnail extraction optimized for performance (async, background processing)
- [ ] Cache management includes size limits and LRU eviction policy

## Technical Details
Extend the existing FrameExtractor.swift to support thumbnail generation at arbitrary timestamps. Create a new RallyCacheManager.swift that handles thumbnail caching with configurable size limits and automatic cleanup. Use background queues for thumbnail extraction to avoid blocking the UI thread. Implement cache key strategies based on video ID and timestamp.

## Dependencies
None - this can be developed independently of the stack visualization.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
