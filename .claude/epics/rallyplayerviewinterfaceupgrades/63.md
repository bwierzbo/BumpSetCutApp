# Task: Performance Optimization and Testing

## Description
Comprehensive performance analysis and optimization of the rally player interface to ensure smooth 60 FPS performance across all devices. This includes profiling, memory optimization, and extensive testing with various rally configurations and device scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interface maintains 60 FPS during all animations and gesture interactions
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable with large rally stacks (50+ rallies)
- [ ] Performance is consistent across different device types and orientations
- [ ] All gesture and navigation features work smoothly under stress testing conditions

## Technical Details
Comprehensive optimization approach:
- Profile using Instruments to identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize SwiftUI view updates and reduce unnecessary recomputations
- Implement efficient memory management for large rally collections
- Add performance monitoring and logging for production debugging
- Stress test with various rally counts and rapid user interactions

Files affected:
- All modified files from previous tasks
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Memory management improvements across the rally player system

## Dependencies
This task must be completed after all other tasks (001-007) as it requires the full implementation to be in place for comprehensive testing and optimization.

## Effort Estimate
