# Stream A: Enhanced Shadow System

## Scope
Replace basic static shadows with progressive shadow system, implement depth-based shadow calculations, and integrate with existing animation coordination system for smooth transitions.

## Files
- BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/RallyPlayerView.swift

## Progress
- ✅ Starting implementation
- ✅ Replaced static shadow system with progressive depth-based calculations
- ✅ Implemented depth-based scaling factors with enhanced perspective (1.0, 0.94, 0.88)
- ✅ Added opacity gradients coordinated with AnimationCoordinator progress
- ✅ Integrated shadow transitions with existing animation timing curves
- ✅ Optimized rendering performance with animation-aware calculations
- ✅ Testing completed - enhanced shadow system working correctly

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Shadow Functions
- `calculateShadowOpacity()`: Progressive opacity (0.15, 0.25, 0.35...) with animation coordination
- `calculateShadowRadius()`: Progressive blur radius (4, 7, 10...) with depth enhancement
- `calculateShadowOffset()`: Dynamic shadow positioning with gesture-based influences
- `calculateCardScale()`: Enhanced depth-based scaling with stronger perspective
- `calculateCardOffsets()`: Perspective-aware positioning with animation coordination
- `calculateCardOpacity()`: Dynamic opacity gradients for enhanced depth perception

### Performance Optimizations
- Animation-aware calculations that only compute complex values during active animations
- Cached base values to reduce computational overhead
- Efficient guard clauses to prevent unnecessary calculations for top cards
- Coordinated with existing AnimationCoordinator timing for smooth transitions

### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated with existing AnimationCoordinator system from issue #58
- Maintains compatibility with card stack visualization from issue #56
- Uses existing animation curves (stackRevealAnimation, peelAnimation) for consistency
- Preserves all existing gesture interactions and transitions

## Result
Enhanced 3D depth perception with progressive shadows that respond smoothly to user interactions and animation states, providing a convincing layered card stack effect with optimized rendering performance.
