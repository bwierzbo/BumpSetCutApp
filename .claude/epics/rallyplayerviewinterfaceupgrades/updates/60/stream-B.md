# Stream B: Enhanced Thumbnail Prefetching

## Scope
Extend thumbnail prefetching to positions 4-6 ahead, optimize background prefetching queue, and enhance memory pressure handling.

## Files
- BumpSetCut/Infrastructure/Media/FrameExtractor.swift
- BumpSetCut/Domain/Services/RallyCacheManager.swift

## Progress
- ✅ Starting implementation
- ✅ Enhanced FrameExtractor with timestamp-based frame extraction
- ✅ Added extended prefetching for positions 4-6 ahead with background processing
- ✅ Implemented PrefetchQueueManager for organized queue management
- ✅ Added enhanced telemetry tracking with detailed prefetch metrics
- ✅ Integrated memory pressure handling to clear prefetch queues
- ✅ Enhanced RallyCacheManager with FrameExtractor coordination
- ✅ Added priority-based prefetching (immediate vs extended)
- ✅ Implemented smart prefetch based on navigation context
- ✅ Added performance monitoring and cache synchronization

## Implementation Summary

### FrameExtractor Enhancements
- **Timestamp-based Extraction**: Added `extractFrame(at timestamp)` method for specific frame extraction
- **Extended Prefetching**: Implemented `prefetchFramesExtended()` for positions 4-6 ahead with low-priority background processing
- **Queue Management**: Added `PrefetchQueueManager` with separate queues for immediate (1-3 ahead) and extended (4-6 ahead) prefetching
- **Background Processing**: Timer-based queue processing with priority handling
- **Memory Pressure Integration**: Enhanced memory pressure handling to clear prefetch queues appropriately
- **Performance Telemetry**: Detailed tracking of prefetch success rates, cache hits, and memory pressure events

### RallyCacheManager Coordination
- **Priority System**: Added `PrefetchPriority` enum for coordinating immediate vs extended prefetching
- **Batch Operations**: Implemented `batchPrefetchThumbnails()` for optimized multi-video prefetch scheduling
- **Smart Prefetching**: Context-aware prefetching based on navigation position in video stack
- **Status Monitoring**: Integration with FrameExtractor metrics for comprehensive prefetch status
- **Cache Synchronization**: Proper coordination between thumbnail cache and frame cache

### Key Technical Features
- **Memory Efficient**: Respects memory pressure and automatically reduces prefetch activity
- **Priority-Based**: Immediate prefetches (positions 1-3) get higher priority than extended (4-6)
- **Background Processing**: Extended prefetching runs on low-priority background queues
- **Intelligent Queueing**: Automatic deduplication and cache checking before queuing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for debugging and optimization

## Coordination Notes
This stream works in coordination with:
- **Stream A**: Player management system will use the prefetched frames
- **Stream C**: Rally segment preloading will benefit from enhanced frame extraction
The enhanced prefetching system provides the foundation for smooth video transitions with extended lookahead.
