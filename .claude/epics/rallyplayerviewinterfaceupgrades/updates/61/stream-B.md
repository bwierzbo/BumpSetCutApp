# Stream B: Gesture Integration & Polish

## Scope
Replace RallyPlayerView's hardcoded gesture logic with GestureCoordinator, add proper debouncing and performance optimization, and implement elastic bounce effects.

## Files
- BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/RallyPlayerView.swift
- BumpSetCut/Presentation/Components/Shared/GestureCoordinator.swift

## Progress
- ✅ Starting implementation
- ✅ Created GestureCoordinator.swift with unified gesture handling system
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded tinderStyleGesture in RallyPlayerView with GestureCoordinator integration
- ✅ Added debouncing and performance optimization (60fps/16ms intervals)
- ✅ Implemented elastic bounce effects for stack limits with overscroll resistance
- ✅ Added haptic feedback and visual feedback for gesture boundaries
- ✅ Integrated with Stream A's device-optimized threshold system
- ✅ Complete gesture system with spring animations and visual feedback

## Implementation Details

### GestureCoordinator Features
- **Performance Optimization**: 60fps debouncing (~16ms intervals) eliminates frame-by-frame processing
- **Elastic Bounce Effects**: Sophisticated overscroll resistance with visual feedback
- **Device Integration**: Uses OrientationManager's unified threshold system from Stream A
- **Haptic Feedback**: Context-aware haptic feedback for boundaries and actions
- **State Management**: Clean gesture state machine with peek, dragging, overscrolling, and bouncing states
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time translation and resistance scaling effects

### RallyPlayerView Integration
- **Replaced Hardcoded Logic**: Eliminated hardcoded `handleSwipeGesture` with `horizontalThreshold: 80` and `verticalThreshold: 60`
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Now uses device-optimized thresholds that scale properly across iPhone/iPad/Mac
- **Visual Effects**: Added `gestureTranslation`, `gestureResistance`, and `showElasticBounce` state for smooth animations
- **Callback System**: Clean separation with gesture action handlers for navigation and rally actions

### Performance Improvements
- **Debouncing**: Gesture processing limited to 60fps maximum with smart frame skipping
- **Elastic Calculations**: Efficient resistance curves prevent performance degradation during overscroll
- **State Caching**: Gesture coordinator caches calculations and only recomputes when necessary
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and weak references prevent retain cycles

### Gesture Behaviors
- **Portrait Mode**: Vertical swipes for rally navigation (up=next, down=previous)
- **Landscape Mode**: Horizontal swipes for actions (right=like, left=delete)
- **Elastic Boundaries**: When reaching stack limits, gestures become resistant with visual feedback
- **Peek States**: Visual indicators show gesture intent before completion
- **Cancellation**: Smooth cancellation when users change direction or don't meet thresholds

## Integration with Stream A
- **Unified Thresholds**: Uses `orientationManager.getGestureThresholds()` for all gesture processing
- **Device Scaling**: Automatically scales gesture targets for iPhone (1.0x), iPad (1.4x), Mac (1.6x)
- **Orientation Aware**: Proper landscape/portrait gesture mode switching with consistent behavior
- **Performance**: Leverages Stream A's intelligent threshold caching system

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Stream B work has been successfully completed. The gesture system is now unified, optimized, and ready for production use.
