# Task: Stack Animation Coordination

## Description
Implement sophisticated animation coordination that synchronizes peel animations with stack reveal effects. This creates smooth, spring-based transitions as users navigate through the video stack, with cards elegantly moving between foreground and background positions with appropriate timing and easing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Peel animations properly synchronized with stack card transitions
- [x] Spring animations implemented for natural card movement feel
- [x] Animation timing coordinated to prevent visual conflicts or jarring transitions
- [x] Performance optimized to maintain 60fps during complex animation sequences

## Technical Details
Build upon the foundation from Task 001 to add coordinated animations in RallyPlayerView.swift. Implement SwiftUI spring animations with appropriate damping and stiffness values. Use animation phases to coordinate peel gestures with stack repositioning. Ensure animations are cancellable and properly handle interrupted gestures. Consider using AnimationPhase for complex multi-step animations.

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Stack Visualization Foundation (required for base stack structure)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Tests written and passing (build successful)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code reviewed
- [x] Deployed to staging (tested on device)
