# Task: Depth Indicators and Shadows

## Description
Add visual depth indicators and shadow layers between stacked cards to enhance the 3D card stack appearance. Implement depth-based scaling and opacity adjustments to create a convincing layered effect where cards appear to be physically stacked with appropriate shadows and perspective.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shadow layers rendered between each stacked card with appropriate blur and opacity
- [ ] Depth-based scaling applied to background cards (slight size reduction for depth)
- [ ] Opacity adjustments implemented for cards further back in the stack
- [ ] Smooth transitions when cards move between depth layers during navigation

## Technical Details
Enhance the RallyPlayerView.swift card rendering system to include shadow calculations and depth-based visual effects. Implementation will involve:
- Adding shadow modifiers with depth-appropriate blur radius and offset
- Implementing scaling factors based on card position in stack
- Applying opacity gradients for depth perception
- Ensuring smooth animations during card transitions

Files affected: RallyPlayerView.swift

## Dependencies
Depends on Task 001 (Card Stack Layout Foundation) to establish the basic stack positioning before adding visual depth effects.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
