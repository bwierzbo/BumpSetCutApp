# Task: Progress Indicator UI

## Description
Add visual indicators to help users understand their position within the rally stack and provide context about remaining content. This includes a subtle position indicator and rally count display that doesn't interfere with video viewing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Stack position indicator shows current rally number and total count
- [ ] Remaining rally count is displayed in an unobtrusive manner
- [ ] Visual feedback clearly communicates stack depth and navigation progress
- [ ] Indicators are appropriately sized and positioned for all device orientations

## Technical Details
Implement UI components that:
- Display current position (e.g., "3 of 12") in a corner or overlay
- Show remaining rally count with smooth transitions
- Provide visual feedback for stack depth through subtle visual cues
- Ensure indicators don't obstruct video content or player controls

Files affected:
- RallyPlayerView.swift (progress indicator overlay components)

## Dependencies
Depends on Task 001 (Stack-based Rally Navigation) for the underlying navigation infrastructure.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
