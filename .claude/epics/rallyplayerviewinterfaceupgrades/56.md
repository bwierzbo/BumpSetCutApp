# Task: Stack Visualization Foundation

## Description
Implement the foundational ZStack-based card stack visualization in RallyPlayerView. This creates the core visual structure showing 2-3 videos stacked with offset and scale transforms to give depth perception. This is the foundation for the entire interface upgrade and must be completed before animation work can begin.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ZStack container added to RallyPlayerView with proper layering
- [ ] 2-3 video cards displayed with offset positioning (depth effect)
- [ ] Scale transforms applied to create visual stack hierarchy
- [ ] Cards properly respond to touch interactions without breaking stack layout

## Technical Details
The implementation will modify RallyPlayerView.swift to replace the current single video display with a stack-based approach. Use ZStack with geometry calculations to position cards with appropriate offsets (e.g., 8px vertical, 4px horizontal) and scale factors (e.g., 0.95, 0.9 for background cards). Ensure the active card remains at full scale and in front.

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundation task for the epic.
