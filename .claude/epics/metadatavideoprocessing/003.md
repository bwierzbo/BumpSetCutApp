# Task: Extend VideoMetadata Model with Metadata Support

## Description
Extend the existing VideoMetadata model to include metadata-related properties and computed fields. Add hasMetadata computed property, metadata file path generation, and integration points for the new metadata workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add hasMetadata computed property that checks for metadata file existence
- [ ] Add metadataFilePath computed property for consistent file path generation
- [ ] Extend existing VideoMetadata init methods to handle metadata checking
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing video libraries
- [ ] Update VideoMetadata tests to cover new metadata-related functionality

## Technical Details
- **Location**: `BumpSetCut/Data/Models/VideoMetadata.swift` (existing file)
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Add computed properties that don't affect existing storage
  - Use MetadataStore service for file existence checking
  - Maintain existing encoding/decoding behavior
- **Key considerations**:
  - Performance impact of file existence checks
  - Lazy loading patterns for metadata properties
  - Thread-safe access to file system operations
- **Files affected**: Existing VideoMetadata.swift, related test files

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: ProcessingMetadata model
- [ ] Task 002: MetadataStore service for file operations
- [ ] Review existing VideoMetadata usage patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6 hours
- Parallel: false (modifies core model used by other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] VideoMetadata extended with metadata properties
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved and tested
- [ ] New metadata properties tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Performance impact measured and optimized
- [ ] Backward compatibility validated with existing video libraries
- [ ] Code reviewed for integration consistency
