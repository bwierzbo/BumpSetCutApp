# Task: Move Domain Layer Files

## Description
Move all business logic and processing files from their current locations to the new Domain layer directory structure. This includes the main video processing service, algorithmic components, and tracking logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Move VideoProcessor to `Domain/Services/`
- [ ] Move logic algorithms to `Domain/Logic/`
- [ ] Move tracking files to `Domain/Tracking/`
- [ ] Update Xcode project references for all moved files
- [ ] Verify all domain logic files are in correct subdirectories

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Move core processing files to Services subdirectory
- Group related algorithmic components in Logic subdirectory
- Isolate tracking-specific logic in Tracking subdirectory

**Files to Move:**
- `Media/Processor/VideoProcessor.swift` → `Domain/Services/`
- `Media/Logic/RallyDecider.swift` → `Domain/Logic/`
- `Media/Logic/BallisticsGate.swift` → `Domain/Logic/`
- `Media/Logic/SegmentBuilder.swift` → `Domain/Logic/`
- `Media/Tracking/KalmanBallTracker.swift` → `Domain/Tracking/`
- `Media/Export/VideoExporter.swift` → `Domain/Services/`
- `Media/Export/DebugAnnotator.swift` → `Domain/Services/`

**Key Considerations:**
- These files contain core business logic for volleyball analysis
- Import dependencies will be updated in later task
- Maintain logical grouping of related functionality

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Directory Setup) must be completed
- [ ] Current video processing functionality working

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Presentation/Data file moves)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All business logic files moved to Domain layer
- [ ] VideoProcessor in Domain/Services/
- [ ] Algorithms properly grouped in Domain/Logic/
- [ ] Tracking logic isolated in Domain/Tracking/
- [ ] Xcode project references updated correctly
- [ ] Ready for import statement updates
