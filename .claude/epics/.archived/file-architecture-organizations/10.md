# Task: Build Testing and Validation

## Description
Perform comprehensive testing to ensure the reorganized codebase builds successfully and all functionality works identically to before the refactoring. This final validation step confirms the file reorganization was successful.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App builds successfully on both device and simulator
- [ ] All existing functionality works identically to before reorganization
- [ ] Camera capture functionality works properly
- [ ] Video processing pipeline functions correctly
- [ ] Video library and playback work as expected
- [ ] No performance regressions observed
- [ ] All UI interactions work properly

## Technical Details
**Testing Strategy:**
- Build for both iOS device and simulator targets
- Perform smoke testing of all major features
- Compare behavior to pre-reorganization functionality
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

**Core Functionality to Test:**
- **Camera Integration**: Video recording, capture interface
- **Video Processing**: Rally detection, debug mode, export functionality  
- **Video Library**: File management, thumbnail display, playback
- **UI Navigation**: All screens, modal presentations, user interactions
- **File Operations**: Video import, export, storage management

**Performance Validation:**
- Video processing speed should be identical
- Memory usage patterns should remain the same
- App launch time should not regress
- UI responsiveness should be maintained

**Build Testing:**
- Clean build from scratch
- Test on multiple iOS versions if available
- Verify no compilation warnings
- Check for any missing resources or assets

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006 (Fix Import Statements) completed
- [ ] All file moves and import updates successful

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M  
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (final validation step)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Clean build with no errors or warnings
- [ ] All major functionality tested and working
- [ ] Camera, processing, and library features validated
- [ ] No performance or behavioral regressions
- [ ] App ready for regular development workflow
- [ ] File reorganization project completed successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
