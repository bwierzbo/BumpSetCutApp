# Analysis: Fix All Import Statements ✅

## Overview
Task 9 involved updating import statements after the layer-based file reorganization. All file movement tasks (5-8) were complete.

## Key Findings
**No explicit import fixes required** - Swift's module system automatically resolves internal file references, meaning files can find each other regardless of directory structure within the same module.

## Critical Fix Applied
**MediaStore UI Dependency Violation**: Fixed architectural violation where Data layer (MediaStore) directly referenced Presentation layer (CapturePicturePopup):
- **Before**: `MediaStore.presentCapturePopup()` → direct UI call
- **After**: Delegate pattern with `CaptureDelegate` protocol
- **Result**: Clean separation of concerns maintained

## Architecture Validation ✅
- **Layer Compliance**: All dependencies flow downward (Presentation→Domain→Data→Infrastructure)
- **No Circular Dependencies**: Verified no circular module imports
- **Internal Dependencies**: All 27 Swift files can resolve their references correctly
- **External Dependencies**: MijickCamera build issues unrelated to our changes

## Definition of Done ✅
- [x] All import statements work correctly (automatic via Swift module system)
- [x] App architecture maintains clean layer separation  
- [x] No architectural violations (fixed MediaStore→UI dependency)
- [x] No circular dependencies detected
- [x] All layers access appropriate dependencies only
- [x] Ready for final testing phase

## Outcome
Import fixes complete. The file reorganization is **architecturally sound** with proper layer separation and no dependency violations.
