# Task: Move Presentation Layer Files

## Description
Move all UI-related files from their current locations to the new Presentation layer directory structure. This includes SwiftUI views, reusable components, and modal presentations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Move all files from `UI/View/` to `Presentation/Views/`
- [ ] Move all files from `UI/Components/` to `Presentation/Components/`
- [ ] Move popup files to `Presentation/Popups/`
- [ ] Update Xcode project references for all moved files
- [ ] Verify all UI files are in correct Presentation subdirectories

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Xcode's move functionality to maintain project references
- Move files in groups to minimize build disruption
- Verify each move maintains proper file associations

**Files to Move:**
- `UI/View/ContentView.swift` → `Presentation/Views/`
- `UI/View/ProcessVideoView.swift` → `Presentation/Views/`
- `UI/View/LibraryView.swift` → `Presentation/Views/`
- `UI/View/VideoPlayerView.swift` → `Presentation/Views/`
- `UI/Components/Action Button/ActionButton.swift` → `Presentation/Components/`
- `UI/Components/Stored Video/StoredVideo.swift` → `Presentation/Components/`
- `UI/View/Popups/CaptureViewPopup.swift` → `Presentation/Popups/`

**Build Impact:**
- Import statements will be updated in later task
- Expect build errors until imports are fixed

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Directory Setup) must be completed
- [ ] Current UI functionality working before move

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Domain/Data file moves)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All UI files moved to Presentation layer
- [ ] Xcode project references updated correctly
- [ ] No missing files in original UI directory
- [ ] File structure matches epic specification
- [ ] Ready for import statement updates
