# Testing & Performance

## Overview
Validate with large collections, edge cases, and performance optimization to ensure the file browser LibraryView works reliably at scale with excellent user experience.

## Requirements

### Large Collection Testing
- Test with 100+ videos across multiple folders
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- UI responsiveness with large datasets
- Virtualization for video grids and lists
- Lazy loading for thumbnails and metadata

### Edge Case Validation
- Empty folder handling and messaging
- Corrupted file detection and handling
- Network interruption during operations
- Insufficient storage space scenarios
- Permission denied error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Component rendering optimization with React.memo
- Efficient state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Image loading optimization with caching
- Database query optimization for metadata retrieval
- Bundle size analysis and code splitting

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow testing across all features
- Cross-component interaction validation
- State consistency across complex operations
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- User experience flow validation

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Memory leak detection and prevention
- Render time profiling for optimization
- Network request optimization and batching
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Load Testing
- Simulated large video collections for testing
- Stress testing with concurrent operations
- Memory pressure testing with limited resources
- Network throttling for slow connection testing
- Device performance testing on lower-end hardware

### Error Handling Framework
- Comprehensive error boundaries for React components
- Graceful degradation strategies for failed operations
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Logging and monitoring for production debugging
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Test Suite Expansion
- Unit tests for all new components and services
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency
- Accessibility testing for screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Dependencies
- Task 004: LibraryView foundation must be complete
- Task 005: Video management features need testing
- Task 006: Upload enhancement requires validation
- Task 007: Search & sorting needs performance testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App remains responsive with 100+ videos loaded
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- [ ] All edge cases handled with proper error messages
- [ ] Performance metrics meet target thresholds
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all feature combinations
- [ ] Error recovery works for network/storage issues
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met for screen readers
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Testing
- Load test with progressively larger video collections
- Memory profiling during extended usage sessions
- Network failure simulation during critical operations
- Storage limitation testing with full disk scenarios
- Accessibility audit with screen reader testing
- Performance regression testing after optimizations
- User acceptance testing with real-world usage patterns
