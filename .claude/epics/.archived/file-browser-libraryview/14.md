# Folder Operations

## Description
Implement comprehensive folder management functionality including create, rename, delete, and navigate operations. This provides the core business logic for folder manipulation that will be used by the UI and other components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement create folder with validation (name uniqueness, valid characters)
- [ ] Implement rename folder with conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Implement delete folder with options for handling contained videos
- [ ] Implement folder navigation with breadcrumb path generation
- [ ] Add move folder functionality with hierarchy validation
- [ ] Implement bulk operations for multiple folders/videos
- [ ] Add folder search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for all operations

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify/Create:
- `/BumpSetCut/Data/Storage/FolderManager.swift` - Core folder operations
- `/BumpSetCut/Data/Storage/MediaStore.swift` - Integration with existing store
- `/BumpSetCut/Business Logic/FolderService.swift` - Business logic layer
- `/BumpSetCut/Models/FolderOperation.swift` - Operation result types

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Folder Creation:**
   - Validate folder names (no special characters, length limits)
   - Check for name conflicts within parent folder
   - Generate unique folder paths
   - Handle nested folder creation

2. **Folder Management:**
   - Implement rename with collision detection
   - Provide delete options: move videos to parent, delete with videos
   - Support folder moving with circular reference prevention
   - Add undo/redo capabilities for destructive operations

3. **Navigation & Search:**
   - Generate breadcrumb paths for current location
   - Implement folder tree traversal utilities
   - Add search functionality across folder names and paths
   - Support filtering by folder properties

4. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Multi-select folder operations
   - Batch move videos between folders
   - Progress tracking for long-running operations
   - Atomic transaction support for consistency

## Dependencies
- **Depends on Task 001:** Requires data model to be implemented
- **Depends on Task 002:** Requires migration/compatibility layer for safe operations

## Effort Estimate
- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 10
- **Complexity:** Medium-High due to hierarchy validation and bulk operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] Unit tests for all folder operations
- [ ] Integration tests with MediaStore
- [ ] Performance tests for bulk operations
- [ ] Error handling thoroughly tested
- [ ] Concurrent operation safety verified
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] API documentation for folder operations
