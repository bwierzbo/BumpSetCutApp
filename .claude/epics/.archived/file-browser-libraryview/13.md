# Migration & Compatibility

## Description
Ensure backward compatibility and implement data migration strategies for existing videos when introducing the new folder-based data model. This task handles the transition from the current flat video structure to the new hierarchical folder system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create migration script for existing videos to assign to default folder
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility layer for old API calls
- [ ] Ensure existing video references continue to work
- [ ] Create data validation routines for migrated content
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanism for failed migrations
- [ ] Add migration progress tracking and logging
- [ ] Test migration with various data scenarios (empty, large datasets)
- [ ] Provide clear migration status reporting to users

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify/Create:
- `/BumpSetCut/Data/Storage/Migrations/FolderMigration.swift` - Main migration logic
- `/BumpSetCut/Data/Storage/MediaStore.swift` - Compatibility methods
- `/BumpSetCut/Data/Storage/MigrationManager.swift` - Migration orchestration

### Implementation Approach:
1. **Migration Strategy:**
   - Create default "Library" folder for existing videos
   - Batch process existing videos to assign folder relationships
   - Maintain original video IDs and metadata

2. **Compatibility Layer:**
   - Implement wrapper methods for legacy video queries
   - Ensure old video access patterns continue working
   - Add deprecation warnings for old methods

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Verify all videos have valid folder assignments
   - Check referential integrity after migration
   - Validate folder hierarchy consistency

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement comprehensive rollback on migration failure
   - Log detailed migration progress and errors
   - Provide recovery mechanisms for partial failures

## Dependencies
- **Depends on Task 001:** Requires the new data model to be implemented before migration can occur

## Effort Estimate
- **Size:** S (Small)
- **Hours:** 8
- **Complexity:** Medium due to data integrity requirements

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] Migration script thoroughly tested with sample data
- [ ] Rollback mechanism verified working
- [ ] Performance testing with large video libraries
- [ ] Error handling and logging comprehensive
- [ ] User documentation for migration process
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Integration tests for compatibility layer
