# Task: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing coverage for peek functionality including unit tests, performance validation, and edge case handling. Ensure production readiness through thorough quality assurance across different devices and scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for FrameExtractor service covering extraction and caching
- [ ] Gesture integration tests for peek progress callbacks
- [ ] Performance tests validating <100ms extraction and <10MB memory targets
- [ ] Edge case testing for corrupted videos, memory pressure, and cancellation
- [ ] Device compatibility testing across iPhone 12+ range
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention validation
- [ ] Integration testing with existing rally player functionality

## Technical Details

**Implementation Location:**
- Create: `BumpSetCutTests/Infrastructure/FrameExtractorTests.swift`
- Create: `BumpSetCutTests/Presentation/PeekGestureTests.swift`
- Add performance tests within existing test structure

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for frame extraction with various video formats
- Memory management tests for cache eviction and cleanup
- Performance tests using XCTestMetrics for timing validation
- Integration tests for complete peek gesture workflow
- Error handling tests for edge cases and failure scenarios

**Code Considerations:**
- Use existing testing patterns from current test suite
- Add mock video files for consistent test scenarios
- Implement performance measurement using XCTestMetrics
- Create test helpers for memory usage validation

## Dependencies

- [ ] Complete performance optimization implementation (Task 005)
- [ ] Existing test infrastructure and patterns
- [ ] Sample rally videos for testing scenarios

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 12-16 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires complete implementation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all peek functionality components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated through automated testing
- [ ] Edge case scenarios tested and handled gracefully
- [ ] Memory leak prevention verified through testing
- [ ] Device compatibility confirmed across target range
- [ ] Production deployment readiness achieved
