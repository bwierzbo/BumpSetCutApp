# Task: Integrate Peek Animations with Tinder-Style Transitions

## Description

Coordinate peek frame animations with existing Tinder-style rotation and transition animations to create a seamless, polished navigation experience. Ensure peek frames animate smoothly alongside current video transformations without conflicts or visual artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Peek frames animate in harmony with existing Tinder-style rotations
- [ ] Smooth 60fps animations during entire gesture progression
- [ ] No visual conflicts between current video and peek frame animations
- [ ] Consistent animation timing and easing with existing system
- [ ] Proper animation cleanup on gesture cancellation or completion
- [ ] Performance maintained during complex animation coordination
- [ ] Visual polish matches professional app standards

## Technical Details

**Implementation Location:**
- Enhance: `BumpSetCut/Presentation/Views/TikTokRallyPlayerView.swift`
- Work within existing animation and transition system

**Key Enhancements:**
- Coordinate peek frame entrance/exit with Tinder-style card animations
- Synchronize rotation and scale transforms between current and peek frames
- Fine-tune animation curves for smooth, natural feeling transitions
- Optimize animation performance for complex multi-element scenes

**Code Considerations:**
- Use existing SwiftUI animation modifiers and timing functions
- Ensure peek animations don't interfere with current rotation calculations
- Add proper animation state management for clean transitions
- Test animation performance on target devices (iPhone 12+)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Peek UI overlay system (Task 003) providing base frame display
- [ ] Existing Tinder-style animation infrastructure
- [ ] Current gesture handling and state management system

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: S
- **Hours**: 8-12 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires peek UI foundation)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Peek animations coordinate smoothly with Tinder-style rotations
- [ ] Consistent 60fps performance during gesture progression
- [ ] Professional visual polish matching modern mobile app standards
- [ ] No animation artifacts or visual conflicts
- [ ] Proper animation state cleanup and resource management
- [ ] Animation timing tuned for optimal user experience
