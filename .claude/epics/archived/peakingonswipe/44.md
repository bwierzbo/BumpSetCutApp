# Task: Performance Optimization and Memory Management

## Description

Optimize peek functionality performance and implement comprehensive memory management to ensure smooth operation within existing memory limits. Add monitoring, error handling, and graceful degradation for production reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Frame extraction consistently completes within 100ms target
- [ ] Memory usage increase stays under 10MB peak during peek operations
- [ ] Background queue processing maintains 60fps UI responsiveness
- [ ] Memory pressure monitoring with automatic cache eviction
- [ ] Graceful fallback to current behavior on performance issues
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup on app backgrounding or memory warnings
- [ ] Performance telemetry for monitoring extraction timing

## Technical Details

**Implementation Location:**
- Enhance: `BumpSetCut/Infrastructure/Media/FrameExtractor.swift`
- Add monitoring throughout peek system components

**Key Optimizations:**
- Background queue management with appropriate priority levels
- Memory pressure detection and automatic cache cleanup
- Performance monitoring and telemetry collection
- Graceful degradation strategies for older devices or low memory

**Code Considerations:**
- Add memory monitoring using `NSProcessInfo` memory pressure detection
- Implement automatic cache eviction on memory warnings
- Use appropriate dispatch queue priorities for frame extraction
- Add performance logging for extraction timing validation

## Dependencies

- [ ] Complete peek animation integration (Task 004)
- [ ] FrameExtractor service with LRU caching system
- [ ] Existing memory management patterns (sliding window limits)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 10-14 hours
- **Parallel**: false (requires complete system for optimization)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Performance benchmarks consistently met (<100ms extraction, <10MB memory)
- [ ] Memory pressure monitoring active with automatic cleanup
- [ ] Background processing optimized for UI responsiveness
- [ ] Graceful degradation implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance telemetry logging in place
- [ ] System ready for production deployment
