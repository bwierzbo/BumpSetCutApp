# Task: Create ProcessingMetadata Model and JSON Schema

## Description
Create the foundational ProcessingMetadata Swift model that represents volleyball analysis results including rally timestamps, ball trajectories, and ML confidence data. This model will serve as the bridge between VideoProcessor output and metadata persistence.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ProcessingMetadata struct implements Codable for JSON encoding/decoding
- [ ] Model includes all fields from PRD schema: video_id, rallies, court_detection, processing_stats
- [ ] Rally struct contains: id, start_time, end_time, confidence, ball_trajectory, projectile_phases
- [ ] BallTrajectoryPoint struct with frame, timestamp, x, y, confidence fields
- [ ] Schema versioning support with processing_version field
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for encoding/decoding with sample data

## Technical Details
- **Location**: `BumpSetCut/Data/Models/ProcessingMetadata.swift`
- **Implementation approach**: Swift Codable structs with nested types
- **Key considerations**:
  - Use consistent naming conventions with existing VideoMetadata
  - Ensure Float/Double precision for trajectory coordinates
  - Include validation for required fields and reasonable value ranges
- **Files affected**: New file in Data/Models directory

## Dependencies
- [ ] Review existing VideoMetadata model for consistency
- [ ] Validate JSON schema against sample volleyball analysis data

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8 hours
- Parallel: true (standalone model creation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive property definitions
- [ ] Unit tests written covering encoding/decoding scenarios
- [ ] Tests validate schema versioning and backward compatibility
- [ ] Code reviewed for naming consistency with existing models
- [ ] Documentation includes JSON schema examples
