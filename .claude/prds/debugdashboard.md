# PRD: Debug Dashboard Integration

## Executive Summary

Integrate the existing TrajectoryDebugger backend and DebugDashboardView UI into the BumpSetCut app's video processing workflow. This developer-focused feature will provide post-processing access to comprehensive trajectory analysis, performance metrics, and parameter tuning capabilities through a dedicated dashboard accessible after video processing completion.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Currently, the powerful debug visualization system built in the detection-logic-upgrades epic is not accessible to users. The TrajectoryDebugger collects comprehensive metrics (R² scores, trajectory quality, classification confidence, performance data) but there's no UI integration to view, analyze, or act on this data.

**Why is this important now?**
- Developer needs visibility into detection accuracy with "actual numeric accuracy values"
- Parameter optimization requires data-driven insights from real video processing
- Large video processing issues need diagnostic capabilities
- Physics-based trajectory filtering needs validation and tuning tools

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona: Developer (Benjamin)
- **Role**: App developer optimizing volleyball detection algorithms
- **Goals**: Improve detection accuracy, optimize parameters, debug processing issues
- **Context**: Processing videos of various sizes to validate enhanced detection logic

### User Journey: Debug-Enabled Video Processing

**As a developer, I want to:**

1. **Enable Debug Mode**
   - Access debug toggle in processing settings
   - Understand performance impact of debug collection
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear debug mode toggle with performance disclaimer

2. **Process Video with Debug Data Collection**
   - Process any video with comprehensive metrics collection active
   - See enhanced console logging during processing
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Debug data collected only when enabled, no impact on regular processing

3. **Access Debug Dashboard Post-Processing**
   - Find "View Debug Dashboard" button in processed video results
   - Access dashboard immediately after processing completion
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Button appears only for debug-processed videos

4. **Analyze Trajectory Performance**
   - View 2D trajectory plots with quality scores
   - See physics validation results (R² distribution)
   - Analyze movement classification breakdown (airborne/carried/rolling)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All 5 dashboard tabs functional with real data

5. **Optimize Detection Parameters**
   - Access real-time parameter tuning interface
   - Apply parameter changes and see impact predictions
   - Export optimized parameters for permanent application
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Parameter changes affect processing with immediate feedback

6. **Export Debug Data for Analysis**
   - Export comprehensive data in JSON format for external analysis
   - Export trajectory data in CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Valid, complete data export in both formats

7. **Manage Debug Data Lifecycle**
   - Debug data persists with associated video
   - Debug data is deleted when video is deleted
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: No orphaned debug data, clean deletion workflow

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Debug Mode Integration**
- Add debug mode toggle to ProcessVideoView
- Display debug mode status during processing
- Enhanced logging output when debug mode active

**FR2: Dashboard Access Point**
- "View Debug Dashboard" button in processed video results
- Button visible only for videos processed with debug mode
- Navigation to full-screen debug dashboard

**FR3: Debug Dashboard UI**
- 5-tab interface: Trajectory, Classification, Physics, Performance, Parameters
- Real-time data visualization with charts and statistics
- Interactive parameter tuning with live feedback
- Export functionality for JSON and CSV formats

**FR4: Data Persistence & Lifecycle**
- Debug data stored with video metadata
- Persistent across app sessions
- Automatic cleanup when associated video deleted
- No debug data collection when debug mode disabled

**FR5: Performance Monitoring**
- Track processing FPS, memory usage, CPU utilization
- Monitor detection latency and accuracy metrics
- Display physics validation statistics and trends

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Performance**
- Debug data collection adds <5% processing overhead
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- No impact on regular (non-debug) video processing

**NFR2: Storage Efficiency**
- Debug data compressed to minimize storage impact
- Configurable retention limits (default: 100 debug sessions)
- Automatic cleanup of oldest debug data when limit reached

**NFR3: Usability**
- Developer-focused interface with technical details
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming data presentation
- Clear visual indicators for data quality and trends

**NFR4: Reliability**
- Debug system failures don't impact video processing
- Graceful degradation when debug data unavailable
- Error handling for corrupted or incomplete debug sessions

## Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- Developer can identify parameter optimization opportunities within 2 minutes of processing
- R² correlation improvements measurable through dashboard analytics
- Processing performance regressions detectable through dashboard metrics
- Parameter tuning results in measurable accuracy improvements

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Debug dashboard usage frequency (target: used for 90% of test video processing)
- Time from processing completion to parameter adjustment (target: <5 minutes)
- Successful debug data export rate (target: 100% for completed sessions)
- Zero crashes or data corruption in debug data lifecycle

**Qualitative Success Indicators:**
- Developer reports increased confidence in parameter tuning decisions
- Faster identification of processing issues and bottlenecks
- Improved detection accuracy through data-driven parameter optimization

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing TrajectoryDebugger and DebugDashboardView components
- Cannot impact performance of regular (non-debug) video processing
- Must work with existing video storage and metadata systems
- Limited to iOS SwiftUI implementation

**Timeline Constraints:**
- Implementation should leverage existing debug components (80% already built)
- Focus on integration points rather than new feature development
- Target completion within 1-2 development sessions

**Resource Constraints:**
- Single developer implementation
- Must maintain existing app stability and performance
- Storage overhead should be minimal for debug data

**Assumptions:**
- Developer has write access to ProcessVideoView and related UI components
- Existing TrajectoryDebugger provides all necessary data structures
- Current video storage system can accommodate additional metadata
- Debug mode will be used primarily during development and testing phases

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- Multi-user debug access or permissions system
- Debug data sharing or cloud synchronization
- Advanced statistical analysis tools beyond basic visualization
- Debug mode for live camera processing (video files only)
- Debug data comparison between multiple processing sessions
- Automated parameter optimization algorithms
- Debug dashboard for non-technical users

**Future Considerations (not in this release):**
- Batch processing debug analysis
- Historical trend analysis across multiple videos
- A/B testing framework integration
- Export to external analytics platforms

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Existing TrajectoryDebugger class (Domain/Debug/TrajectoryDebugger.swift)
- Existing DebugDashboardView UI (Presentation/Debug/DebugDashboardView.swift)
- ProcessVideoView for UI integration point
- MediaStore for video metadata and lifecycle management
- VideoProcessor for debug mode integration

**External Dependencies:**
- SwiftUI Charts framework (already imported)
- AVFoundation for video processing integration
- iOS storage APIs for debug data persistence

**Integration Points:**
- ProcessVideoView.swift: Add debug mode toggle and dashboard access
- VideoProcessor.swift: Integrate debug data collection
- MediaStore.swift: Handle debug data lifecycle with video deletion
- Existing debug components: Connect to UI workflow
